## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Caeden01/West-Bloomfield-Library-Poem-Collector
    ```

2. Create a MySQL database "wb_library_poem_project". Using phpMyAdmin, copy the following script.
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE `issue_tickets` (
      `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      `name` text NOT NULL,
      `email` text NOT NULL,
      `subject` text NOT NULL,
      `issue` text NOT NULL,
      `status` enum('open','closed') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'open',
      `securityInformation` text NOT NULL
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci;

    CREATE TABLE `poems` (
      `id` varchar(255) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      `name` text NOT NULL,
      `email` text NOT NULL,
      `title` text NOT NULL,
      `poem` text NOT NULL,
      `timestamp` text NOT NULL,
      `securityInformation` text NOT NULL,
      `history` text NOT NULL,
      `comments` mediumtext NOT NULL,
      `commentSecurityInformation` mediumtext NOT NULL,
      `printHistory` mediumtext NOT NULL,
      `status` enum('Pending','Approved','Rejected') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Pending'
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci;

    CREATE TABLE `printer_queue` (
      `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      `title` text NOT NULL,
      `author` text NOT NULL,
      `added_by` text NOT NULL,
      `poem_id` text NOT NULL,
      `queue_number` int(11) NOT NULL,
      `created_at` timestamp NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp()
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci;

    CREATE TABLE `users` (
      `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      `username` varchar(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
      `password` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
      `parent_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
      `tier` enum('low','medium','high','') NOT NULL,
      `banned` tinyint(4) DEFAULT 0,
      KEY `parent_id` (`parent_id`)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci;
    ```

3. Set up a moderator account. Replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME with your name and then copy and paste the script into phpMyAdmin.
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO `users` (`username`, `parent_id`, `tier`, `banned`)
    VALUES ('YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME', NULL, 'high', 0);
    ```

4. Enter the file "include.php" and make the following changes:
    1. Enter your MySQL database credentials into "$username" and "$password".
    2. Set up an authorization token â€” make sure it matches the one you set up here (https://github.com/Caeden01/wb-library-poem-collector-printer-drivers)
    3. Create a QR code for the URL the project is hosted on. Include that QR code under "./images/qr_code.png". If you store at that specific path, there is no need to update the variable "website_qr_code".
    4. Set up your library config information ("library_name", "library_logo", "library_logo_bw", "library_website", "website_qr_code", and "url_comment_path")
    5. (Optional) Set up Google reCAPTCHA.
        - Set "use_captcha" to true
        - Enter your reCAPTCHA public and private keys under "captcha_public_key" and "captcha_private_key"

5. Finish setting up your moderator account
    1. Visit the website URL
    2. Navigate to the login page
    3. Sign in like you would if you had a password configured and it will set up that password automatically.

6. Set up printer
